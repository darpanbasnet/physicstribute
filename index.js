            point3: `Quantum Mechanics: Heisenberg's work played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics as a comprehensive theory. He contributed to the formulation and understanding of quantum principles, including the probabilistic nature of measurements and the wave-particle duality of particles.`,
            point4: `Nuclear Physics: Heisenberg made significant contributions to nuclear physics, particularly in the understanding of nuclear structure and interactions. His pioneering work on quantum field theory and the concept of isospin helped advance our understanding of the atomic nucleus.`,
            point5: `Philosophical Implications: Heisenberg's work and his discussions with Niels Bohr on the interpretation of quantum mechanics raised profound philosophical questions. Heisenberg's views emphasized the inherent limitations of measurement and the probabilistic nature of the quantum world, sparking debates about the nature of reality and the role of observation in physics.`

  point1: `Schr√∂dinger's wave equation: Developed a mathematical equation known as Schr√∂dinger's wave equation, which describes the behavior of quantum particles, including electrons. It introduced the concept of wave functions, allowing the calculation of probabilities for different particle properties.`,
  point2: `Wave-particle duality: Schr√∂dinger contributed to the understanding of wave-particle duality, proposing that particles, such as electrons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This concept revolutionized our understanding of the nature of matter, highlighting the dual nature of particles.`,
  point3: `Formulation of quantum mechanics: Schr√∂dinger made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics. He formulated it in terms of wave mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding quantum phenomena. His work demonstrated the probabilistic nature of quantum systems and allowed for the prediction of particle behavior.`,
  point4: `Schr√∂dinger equation for hydrogen atom: Schr√∂dinger derived an equation, known as the Schr√∂dinger equation, to describe the energy levels and behavior of electrons in a hydrogen atom. This equation provided a more accurate description of atomic structure, accounting for electron wave functions and their corresponding energy states.`,
  point5: `Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment: Schr√∂dinger proposed a famous thought experiment known as Schr√∂dinger's cat. It involves a hypothetical cat that can be both alive and dead simultaneously, illustrating the strange consequences of quantum superposition and entanglement. This experiment highlights the peculiar nature of quantum systems and the role of observation in collapsing quantum states.`,
